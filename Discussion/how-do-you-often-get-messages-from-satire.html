  <h3 class="w3-center">How often do you get messages from satire? </h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 15/07/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p> 
On Friday 22nd of June 2022, the supreme court of Nigeria in a majority decision of six 
and one objection ruled in favor of wearing of hijab (head covering worn by muslim women) 
in Lagos state primary and secondary schools. 
Stating the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria section 38 of the 1999 constitution 
which gives every citizen the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, forgetting 
that this same constitution is tied to a condition in section 38 which states that private rights 
must be exercised privately in our homes, place of worship, and religious schools' that is to 
say, in a public space or an organisation the rule binding them which partains to their 
uniforms is also binding to every member regardless of your religious status or say. 
<p style="color:#413839">This ruling of the apex court brought a lot of objections amongst the christian counterparts</p>
which interpretes this ruling to infringement and abuse of the rights of citizens as it's stated in 
section 10 of the Nigerian constitution which disallow any arm of government to adopt any 
religion as state religion for Nigeria is a secular state. 
A human right lawyer, Malcolm omirohbo tried to speak in volumes his thoughts on this by 
adherering to the ruling of the supreme court by putting on his native attire for a supreme 
court hearing in Abuja on the 23rd of June. 
He was glad the ruling was made , encouraged fellow citizens to follow suit and made 
mention of his children doing the same in their various school. 
Although he was denied the hearing, it brought uproar and a lot of criticizism but then he has 
passed a concrete message in a ridiculous manner. 
Furthermore, it's evident that lawyers like this use the phrase "what is good for the goose is 
also good for the gander " to express their opinion in this situation. 
This is where the word satire comes in; 
Satire can be defined as the use of irony, humor and sacarsm to criticize or show the 
ignorance of people. 
<p style="color:#413839">On this note</p> I'll say the supreme court who we believe and know to be infallible has proven 
to be a human establishment which is prone to mistakes, in truth no man is above mistakes. 
The supreme court has misinterpreted the laws made for it's land. Hence the action of the 
human right lawyer acollade worthy because satire is the only way people get message in this 
part of the world even though the uproar and confusion increases by the day. Rules are rules , 
the beauty of uniformity and unism would not be visible if everyone decides to behave as 
they wish to.
In view of this, a country which deals with the basis of federalism and equity, it is important to know that peoples' viewpoint and opinions should not be overlooked, definitely, their religious beliefs should also be accepted and encouraged. 
<p style="color:#413839">And so I ask again, how often do you get message from satire?..</p>

what you never knew....

Australia is wider than the moon

The Eiffel tower can be 15cm taller during the summer, due to thermal expansion, meaning the iron heats up and the particles gains kinetic energy and takes up more space.

A chef's tall hat (officially known as a "toque") is traditionally made with 100 pleats, meant to represent the 100 ways to cook an egg.

Men used to be the one wearing heels.
In the 10th century, men in Europe adopted the now-gendered fashion choice of heels to make it easier to ride their horses: Adding heels to their boots made it easier to stay in their stirrups. As Slate explains, "The Persian cavalry wore inch-high heels, and the trend spread to Europe. Since they showed that the wearer owned and maintained horses, high heels became associated with the upper class."

Drinking too much water can kill you.
Drinking too much water can be deadly. When guzzling a lot of liquid, you can suffer from water intoxication or hyponatremia, which occurs after an obscene amount of water is consumed, often during endurance events when participants are also losing sodium through their sweat. There have been many notable cases, including the 2002 Boston Marathon competitor Cynthia Lucero, who died from overhydration.

The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 2 billion degrees kelvin. </p>
