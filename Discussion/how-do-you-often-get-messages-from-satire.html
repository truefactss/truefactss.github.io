  <h3 class="w3-center">How often do you get messages from satire? </h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 15/07/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p> 
On Friday 22nd of June 2022, the supreme court of Nigeria in a majority decision of six 
and one objection ruled in favor of wearing of hijab (head covering worn by muslim women) 
in Lagos state primary and secondary schools. 
Stating the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria section 38 of the 1999 constitution 
which gives every citizen the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, forgetting 
that this same constitution is tied to a condition in section 38 which states that private rights 
must be exercised privately in our homes, place of worship, and religious schools' that is to 
say, in a public space or an organisation the rule binding them which partains to their 
uniforms is also binding to every member regardless of your religious status or say. 
<p style="color:#413839">This ruling of the apex court brought a lot of objections amongst the christian counterparts</p>
which interpretes this ruling to infringement and abuse of the rights of citizens as it's stated in 
section 10 of the Nigerian constitution which disallow any arm of government to adopt any 
religion as state religion for Nigeria is a secular state. 
A human right lawyer, Malcolm omirohbo tried to speak in volumes his thoughts on this by 
adherering to the ruling of the supreme court by putting on his native attire for a supreme 
court hearing in Abuja on the 23rd of June. 
He was glad the ruling was made , encouraged fellow citizens to follow suit and made 
mention of his children doing the same in their various school. 
Although he was denied the hearing, it brought uproar and a lot of criticizism but then he has 
passed a concrete message in a ridiculous manner. 
Furthermore, it's evident that lawyers like this use the phrase "what is good for the goose is 
also good for the gander " to express their opinion in this situation. 
This is where the word satire comes in; 
Satire can be defined as the use of irony, humor and sacarsm to criticize or show the 
ignorance of people. 
<p style="color:#413839">On this note</p> I'll say the supreme court who we believe and know to be infallible has proven 
to be a human establishment which is prone to mistakes, in truth no man is above mistakes. 
The supreme court has misinterpreted the laws made for it's land. Hence the action of the 
human right lawyer acollade worthy because satire is the only way people get message in this 
part of the world even though the uproar and confusion increases by the day. Rules are rules , 
the beauty of uniformity and unism would not be visible if everyone decides to behave as 
they wish to.
In view of this, a country which deals with the basis of federalism and equity, it is important to know that peoples' viewpoint and opinions should not be overlooked, definitely, their religious beliefs should also be accepted and encouraged. 
<p style="color:#413839">And so I ask again, how often do you get message from satire?..</p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">Strike: A Foundament lookout for Students' Future</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 10/07/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p>

Since the formation of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in 1978, the union has gone on strike sixteen times according to RNN.NG.

Assault on academic freedom was a subject of resistance by ASUU when the body started operation, the establishment of the body was primarily concerned with broad national issues such as illegal dismissal of staffs whether they are lecturers or not, a good example was when they supported NMA (National Medical Association) and NARD (National Association of Resident Doctors) to protest the sharp deterioration of Nigeria's health services, the body also stood firmly against  oppressive, undemocratic policies in the country.

Throughout the military period, ASUU fought for: 

i. the survival of the university system, with three components: service conditions (salary and non-salary), funding, and university autonomy/academic freedom; the defense of the right to education; and ii. broad national issues such as anti-military struggles, struggles against military rule, struggles against privatization, struggles against the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), and World Bank attestation.

Although it looked after the welfare of its members in the social, political, and economic worlds, it also contributed to the stagnation of education in Nigeria.

Nigeria's educational sector is very cheap, making it easier for the country to have a higher number of literates than other African countries; however, most of the promises made by the government to the body since 2009 have not been met, forcing the body to protest by striking.

In the last six years, there has been one strike every four days, with the longest strike occurring in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic.

 <p style="color:#413839">This period was supposed to be productive</p> and help lecturers teach students some theoretical aspects as it would aid time management and easy access to all students, but most students were at home doing nothing, according to research.

The Association of Staff Unions met with the federal government in 2009 to demand better working conditions, but their request fell on deaf ears. 

The body's national executive council has also stated that there will be no suspension of the ongoing strike until the federal government's renegotiated agreement is fully implemented.

During the two-month strike, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, the current Minister of Education (state), purchased a presidential nomination form worth 100 million naira.

Most students are now disappointed and angry because they are spending more years than they should in school. 

In an interview with an angry University of Lagos student, she stated, "I'm honestly disappointed with the leaders in this country, looking at the aspect of funding and accepting the conditions of ASUU, we would understand that this country as a whole is a mess, there's no money to give ASUU, but they spent billions of naira on the NUGA games in unilag, this is bad."

"I hope this strike ends soon, it's affecting our future," said Miss Victoria Ojo of the same school.
