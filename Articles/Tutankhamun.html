  <h3 class="w3-center">Tutankhamun</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 10/05/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p> Today on facts about who we would be looking at Tutankhamun,
He was commonly referred to as King Tut
He was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. 
His father is believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten.
 His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady".
Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. 
He married his paternal half-sister Ankhesenamun. 
During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term.
His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be incorrect and closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".
Tutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the Valley of the Kings and relocated the capital from Akhetaten back to Thebes. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.
King Tut was the youngest Pharoah to every rule Egypt..</p>

what you never knew....

Australia is wider than the moon

The Eiffel tower can be 15cm taller during the summer, due to thermal expansion, meaning the iron heats up and the particles gains kinetic energy and takes up more space.

A chef's tall hat (officially known as a "toque") is traditionally made with 100 pleats, meant to represent the 100 ways to cook an egg.

Men used to be the one wearing heels.
In the 10th century, men in Europe adopted the now-gendered fashion choice of heels to make it easier to ride their horses: Adding heels to their boots made it easier to stay in their stirrups. As Slate explains, "The Persian cavalry wore inch-high heels, and the trend spread to Europe. Since they showed that the wearer owned and maintained horses, high heels became associated with the upper class."

Drinking too much water can kill you.
Drinking too much water can be deadly. When guzzling a lot of liquid, you can suffer from water intoxication or hyponatremia, which occurs after an obscene amount of water is consumed, often during endurance events when participants are also losing sodium through their sweat. There have been many notable cases, including the 2002 Boston Marathon competitor Cynthia Lucero, who died from overhydration.

The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 2 billion degrees kelvin. </p>
