  <h3 class="w3-center">Tutankhamun</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 10/05/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p> Today on facts about who we would be looking at Tutankhamun,
He was commonly referred to as King Tut
He was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. 
His father is believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten.
 His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady".
Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. 
He married his paternal half-sister Ankhesenamun. 
During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term.
His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be incorrect and closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".
Tutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the Valley of the Kings and relocated the capital from Akhetaten back to Thebes. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.
King Tut was the youngest Pharoah to every rule Egypt..</p>

what you never knew....

Australia is wider than the moon

The Eiffel tower can be 15cm taller during the summer, due to thermal expansion, meaning the iron heats up and the particles gains kinetic energy and takes up more space.

A chef's tall hat (officially known as a "toque") is traditionally made with 100 pleats, meant to represent the 100 ways to cook an egg.

Men used to be the one wearing heels.
In the 10th century, men in Europe adopted the now-gendered fashion choice of heels to make it easier to ride their horses: Adding heels to their boots made it easier to stay in their stirrups. As Slate explains, "The Persian cavalry wore inch-high heels, and the trend spread to Europe. Since they showed that the wearer owned and maintained horses, high heels became associated with the upper class."

Drinking too much water can kill you.
Drinking too much water can be deadly. When guzzling a lot of liquid, you can suffer from water intoxication or hyponatremia, which occurs after an obscene amount of water is consumed, often during endurance events when participants are also losing sodium through their sweat. There have been many notable cases, including the 2002 Boston Marathon competitor Cynthia Lucero, who died from overhydration.

The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 2 billion degrees kelvin. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">Food sustainability in Nigeria</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 15/07/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p>. 

Food sustainability entials the  production of food in a way that protects the environment, makes effective use of natural resources, ensures that manufacturers can support themselves, and promotes the quality of life in communities that produces food.
The ability to sustain food in Nigeria has been a major issue as the prices of staples has increased by a great percentage. Staples like rice, beans, yams, tomatoes that are supposed to be cheap and affordable by average Nigerians has been expensive leading many Nigerians into poverty.
According to UNICEF, Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children in the world with a prevalence rate of 32 percent of children under five. An estimated 2 million children in Nigeria suffer from malnutrition, but only two of every 10 children affected is currently reached treatment. Malnutrition, in addition to an increased risk of death, is linked to poor production and circulation of food in the country.
No doubt, Nigeria is blessed with lots of cash crops and Other Agricultural products ranging from tomatoes to cocoa to cattles and rams but lack proper management and care of the agricultural sector has left Nigerians struggling. 
A country with abundant food tends to live a happier way of life. Improves the living standard of people, reduces social ills and improves health condition of people especially the children and vulnerable ones in the society. Although, recently cases of bandits destroying numerous farms has been rampant not allowing the farmers gain acces to their farmlands leading to scarcity and hike in prices of staples in every part of the country.
According to International Journal Social sciences and humanities invention, For one to have and establish an affective sustenance of agricultural economy in the country, there must be an attitudinal change by the government through diversification of the country’s economy to other sectors of economy most especially the agriculture and industries.
Change of government policy from agricultural neglect to agricultural empowerment at all levels and at all times (example) in china, there was agricultural revolution when hunger was too much in china as the result of their over population. This principle of agricultural revolution boosted other sectors of Chinese economy including the science, technology and industries which are fed with output of agriculture.
According to Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation, " Between January and March 2021, the agriculture contributed to 22.35 percent of the total Gross Domestic Product. Over 70 percent of Nigerians engage in the agriculture sector mainly at a subsistence level.

Despite the contribution to the economy, Nigeria’s agricultural sector faces many challenges which impact on its productivity. These include; poor land tenure system, low level of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation. Others are low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, limited financing, high post-harvest losses and poor access to markets". 
The Nigerian Government has launched and implemented several initiatives and programmes to address the situation including the;  Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP); Nigeria–Africa Trade and Investment Promotion Programme, Presidential Economic Diversification Initiative, Economic and Export Promotion Incentives and the Zero Reject Initiative, Agriculture Promotion Policy (APP), among others.
All these efforts aim to increase agricultural productivity in order to provide sufficient quantities of food to meet domestic demand as well as an abundance of commodity crops for export in the international market. Besides, they aim at reversing forest loss and degradation; promoting sustainable management of natural resources; rehabilitation of degraded lands and reducing erosion and climate vulnerability.
Sustaining food averts the damage and wastage of natural resources. It reduces the contribution to climate change as it often means eating more local food which is not transported too far.
The government should know for a fact that oil production may in no time cease to be our main source of foreign exchange and the population of the country keeps increasing on a yearly basis and need to do something to sustain the county's economy, they should review their agricultural policies and bring to life the country's Agricultural economy to provide adequate food sustainability in the country.
