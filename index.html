<p style="color:#0000FF">Strike: A Foundament lookout for Students' Future</p>


<p style="color:#0000FF">Amusan Abraham</p>




Since the formation of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in 1978, the union has gone on strike sixteen times according to RNN.NG.

Assault on academic freedom was a subject of resistance by ASUU when the body started operation, the establishment of the body was primarily concerned with broad national issues such as illegal dismissal of staffs whether they are lecturers or not, a good example was when they supported NMA (National Medical Association) and NARD (National Association of Resident Doctors) to protest the sharp deterioration of Nigeria's health services, the body also stood firmly against  oppressive, undemocratic policies in the country.

Throughout the military period, ASUU fought for: 

i. the survival of the university system, with three components: service conditions (salary and non-salary), funding, and university autonomy/academic freedom; the defense of the right to education; and ii. broad national issues such as anti-military struggles, struggles against military rule, struggles against privatization, struggles against the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), and World Bank attestation.

Although it looked after the welfare of its members in the social, political, and economic worlds, it also contributed to the stagnation of education in Nigeria.

Nigeria's educational sector is very cheap, making it easier for the country to have a higher number of literates than other African countries; however, most of the promises made by the government to the body since 2009 have not been met, forcing the body to protest by striking.

In the last six years, there has been one strike every four days, with the longest strike occurring in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic.

 This period was supposed to be productive and help lecturers teach students some theoretical aspects as it would aid time management and easy access to all students, but most students were at home doing nothing, according to research.

The Association of Staff Unions met with the federal government in 2009 to demand better working conditions, but their request fell on deaf ears. 

The body's national executive council has also stated that there will be no suspension of the ongoing strike until the federal government's renegotiated agreement is fully implemented.

During the two-month strike, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, the current Minister of Education (state), purchased a presidential nomination form worth 100 million naira.

Most students are now disappointed and angry because they are spending more years than they should in school. 

In an interview with an angry University of Lagos student, she stated, "I'm honestly disappointed with the leaders in this country, looking at the aspect of funding and accepting the conditions of ASUU, we would understand that this country as a whole is a mess, there's no money to give ASUU, but they spent billions of naira on the NUGA games in unilag, this is bad."

"I hope this strike ends soon, it's affecting our future," said Miss Victoria Ojo of the same school.

<p style="color:#0000FF">45-Year-Old Ex-Convict Alleged Molest 4-Year-Old Girl</p>


A 45-year-old man, John Onyeka Patrick (Ex-Convicted), is on the run after being accused of molesting a 4-year-old girl in Lagos State's Owonikoko Ajah area.

Onyeka, who was caught on camera attempting to insert his hand into the girl's private organ, is now on the run after the incident was reported to an Inspector of police in the area, who requested anonymity but confirmed the incident.

According to the victim's mother, Isioma justina ogalonye, the incident happened on January 1, 2022, while she was watching plates in the neighborhood, when Micky, one of her customers, approached her and offered to show her a video.

"On that fateful day, I was watching plate when Micky approached me and said he wanted to show me a video, but I had to promise him I wouldn't fight," she explained. He said that if my daughter comes inside, I shouldn't let her go outside that day, so I asked which of my daughters he was referring to because I had two daughters, and he said the youngest.

"So he showed me the video, and I asked my brother to look at it, saying, "Isn't this Onyeka penetrating his hand to my daughter's private organ?" I told him to wait until I finished watching the plate before making a noise.

"A few minutes later, my daughter came in and said she wanted to tell me something, so I told her I was coming and she should go eat first, so I carried the plate inside, and when I came outside, she was sitting on the pure water I was selling, and she said she was hungry and wanted to tell me something.

"So I opened the door and told her to come inside and tell me what she wanted to tell me; she entered and all she could say was mummy ehmm mummy ehmm, I told her I would not beat her if she told me, she kept saying mummy ehmm, and I asked her what happened under the tree, and she said mummy that's what I want to tell you."

"She said that as I was about to call aunty Joy, I called uncle John, and uncle John told me to come and drag his finger because he was in pain, and as she was dragging the finger, he put his hand inside my boomboom, uncle John then told me to open my legs, and he spit on his hand and told me he wanted it to enter very well."

"He then took a glass of pure water and poured it into his hand, telling me that he wants his hand to enter inside my boomboom and that we should do it in a room."

When I confronted Onyeka, he denied it and demanded to see the girl who had lied against him, as well as the video evidence I claimed to have. I played the video for him, he watched it, and his reaction was.

"Haaaa na me do this maybe na drink"

He claimed he was unaware he was drunk when he did all of this, and he begged and told me to let go.

Despite the fact that I have relocated my daughters to Elekan for their safety, I cannot speak for the fate of the other children here. The man in question is an ex-convict who was released from prison three years ago for fraud, and there are many others like him in the area.
