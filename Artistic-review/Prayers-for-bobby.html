  <h3 class="w3-center">Prayers for Bobby</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Uploaded 15/07/2022 by Abraham</em></p>
  <p> PRAYERS FOR BOBBY is a film  based  on the true story of the life and legacy of Bobby Griffith, a gay teen who killed himself in 1983 due to his mother's homophobia.
Bobby is a queer teenager living in a conservative Christian household, his mother, 
Mary Griffith  is a devout Christian who raises her four children—Ed, Bobby, Joy and Nancy according to the teaching of the presbyterian church, her goal was to see every single member of her family in heaven.
Bobby was a delightful child and was literally the most beloved in the family, his mother loved him dearly,his grandma the same, his siblings adored him, and so he was mounted with the task of not disappointing anyone in any way.
As a teenager when he discovered his attraction to guys it was hard for him to deal with especially with the knowledge that he can't come forward and talk to anyone about it, in his own way he tried to deal with it, he got into a relationship with a girl, but it felt weird, he didn't feel like it was an honest thing to do, not minding the fact that the girl loved him dearly he had to break up with her.
Bobby struggled reconciling his conflicting identities, he was tired, he was depressed, he tried commiting suicide by overdosing himself with aspirin but he resisted the temptations, his brother Ed, finds him with the drugs, Bobby confides to him that he is gay and begged him not to tell anyone, but Ed knew he couldn't handle it alone, he had to find help to cure his brother,do he opens up to their mother.
Life changes for the entire family after their mother, Mary learns about it, In hopes of converting Bobby from gay to straight, she takes him to a psychiatrist, who explains to Bobby's parents that a person's homosexuality is the result of lacking a close relationship with their parents. She then advises Bobby to pray harder and seek solace in Church activities, as well as to arrange a special bonding time with his father. While spending such quality time with his father, Bobby explains his desire to become a writer, to which his father suggests "some dreams are just not realistic."
Slowly Bobby's father and siblings come to terms with his homosexuality, but his mother didn't, she believes homos.exual.ity is sinful and anyone who indulges in that will never make heaven.
Somehow Mary believes God can cure bobby from the homosexual spirit, she made him pray harder, she inscribed bible quotes all over the house to keep Bobby's faith in check.
Bobby was growing tired. To get away from his family, Bobby visits his cousin Jeanette,she has always been accepting of his sexual orientation and tries to help him realize that his mother will never change. Desperate for his mother's approval, he does what is asked of him, but through it all, the Church's disapproval of homosexuality and his mother's attempts to suppress his growing behaviors in public cause him to grow increasingly withdrawn and depressed.
Stricken with guilt, Bobby finds a boyfriend, David, at a gay bar. Nonetheless, before leaving the house with David, Mary informs Bobby that she "will not have a gay son." After Bobby finds David betraying him for another man, he continues to think of his mother's words of prejudice, i.e., when saying "homosexuality is a sin and (gays) are doomed to spend eternity in hell," as well as calling him "sick," "perverted," and "a danger to our children." Following his subsequent depression and self-loathing which intensifies, one night he free falls off of a bridge onto a highway and into the path of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler truck, which kills him instantly. The family receives the news the following day and are devastated.
Faced with their tragedy, Mary begins to question herself and her Church's interpretation of the Scripture. Through her long and emotional journey, Mary slowly reaches out to the gay community and discovers unexpected support from them. She becomes acquainted with a local reverend of the Metropolitan Community Church, who convinces her to attend a meeting of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).

It is there that she recalls Bobby being different from conception and reassures herself that his true value was in his heart.
Mary then gives a speech in a city council meeting supporting a local "gay day" live on television. She tells of her experiences with Bobby, the struggles she had coping with him coming out of the closet and her stubbornness to reevaluate her religious beliefs which were nothing more than "bigotry" and "dehumanizing slander." Mary also acknowledges how she came to realize that Bobby's sexual orientation was quite natural in God's image and his suicide was subsequently due to poor parenting. She concludes her speech by urging people to think before they say, voice, or support homophobia because "a child is listening." The measure is rejected, but Mary and her family travel to San Francisco with fellow PFLAG members and walk in a gay pride parade, during which she sees another young man just like Bobby observing the parade. She walks over and hugs him, finally coming to terms with her son's death and vowing to work hard for the rights of gays and lesbians.
In her words:
"I know now why God didn't heal Bobby. He didn't heal him because there was nothing wrong with him."
Mary spent the remaining of her life supporting and advocating for gay rights, she died in 2020 ,aged 85.
